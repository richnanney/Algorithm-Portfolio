# CSE 381 - Algorithms and Complexity Portfolio

Welcome! I'm Richard Nanney, and this is my portfolio for algorithms and things. There's quite a bit to cover, so please: take off your coat and stay a while. Find a comfy seat. Oop, not that couch, it -- ahh, yeah, sorry. Totally infested with bugs. Now look, they're all over your pants and shoes. That's on you, though; what kind of person keeps their shoes on in the house? ...Hm? What's that? This isn't a house? Oh, right.

This is the landing page. This page serves as a hub for all of the algorithms taught and gone over in the class.

Any explanation or delineation of specific algorithms or code snippets will be done in their respective pages, not out here.
